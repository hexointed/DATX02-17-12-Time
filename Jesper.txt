----Week 1
2017-01-17  02:00  Lecture
            01:00  First meeting with group
        21  04:00  Read up on distance field function generation methods.

----Week 2
        24  02:00  Lecture about project planning.
            05:00  Planning report discussion, ray marching shaders with all 
                   group members.
        27  02:00  Reading about raymarching

----Week 3
        31  02:00  Reading about raymarching, specifically what kind of basic 
                   shapes are easily created and rendered.
            02:00  doing the plagarism and sources assignment

----Week 4 
         7  02:00  Planning report
         10 03:00  Writing on the planning report

----Week 5
         13 04:00  Wrote a unsigned raymarcher shader which shows the distance 
                   function in grey scale. https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldfyRH 
         15 02:00  Made the marcher a little bit better and faster. read some on 
                   lighting.
         17 05:00  Rewrote the shader for better camera management and also 
                   optimized the marching loop in several ways.
         18 04:00  Implemented lighting and realised that I've made several 
                   mistakes of different degrees of severity. For now not much 
                   runs as good as it could and the light shows on the wrong 
                   side of the sphere, which is a problem. The most likely error 
                   is the calculation of the normal for surfaces.
         19 02:00  Messed with git for far to long, no progress with the shader 
                   at all but I'm sure the problem is the way I calculate the 
                   normal of surfaces.

----Week 6
         20 04:00  try to understand and implement a better way to calculate the 
                   normal vector of surfaces
         22 07:00  Helped Jon with his implementation of reflective surfaces and
                   made sure that I understand them.
         23 02:00  Studied up on the way we calculate normal vectors until I 
                   understood why we do it the way we do
            00:30  "prooved" how orthagonal projections are calculated 
                   (we made sure we understand it)  
            01:00  Made sure I understand everything in Jons ray marcher
            00:30  Messed with git
            04:00  Prepared for "handledningstillfälle 1" 
         24 01:30  "Handledningstillfälle 1"
            00:40  Meeting with our groups "helper?"
            01:00  Tried to solve a problem with "repeating scenery"   

Total:      42:00
