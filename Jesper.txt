----Week 1
2017-01-17  02:00  Lecture
            01:00  First meeting with group
        21  04:00  Read up on distance field function generation methods.

----Week 2
        24  02:00  Lecture about project planning.
            05:00  Planning report discussion, ray marching shaders with all 
                   group members.
        27  02:00  Reading about raymarching

----Week 3
        31  02:00  Reading about raymarching, specifically what kind of basic 
                   shapes are easily created and rendered.
            02:00  doing the plagarism and sources assignment

----Week 4 
         7  02:00  Planning report
         10 03:00  Writing on the planning report

----Week 5
         13 04:00  Wrote a unsigned raymarcher shader which shows the distance 
                   function in grey scale. https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldfyRH 
         15 02:00  Made the marcher a little bit better and faster. read some on 
                   lighting.
         17 05:00  Rewrote the shader for better camera management and also 
                   optimized the marching loop in several ways.
         18 04:00  Implemented lighting and realised that I've made several 
                   mistakes of different degrees of severity. For now not much 
                   runs as good as it could and the light shows on the wrong 
                   side of the sphere, which is a problem. The most likely error 
                   is the calculation of the normal for surfaces.
         19 02:00  Messed with git for far to long, no progress with the shader 
                   at all but I'm sure the problem is the way I calculate the 
                   normal of surfaces.
