            01:00  First meeting with group
        21  04:00  Read up on distance field function generation methods.

----Week 2
        24  02:00  Lecture about project planning.
            05:00  Planning report discussion, ray marching shaders with all 
                   group members.
        27  02:00  Reading about raymarching

----Week 3
        31  02:00  Reading about raymarching, specifically what kind of basic 
                   shapes are easily created and rendered.
            02:00  doing the plagarism and sources assignment

----Week 4 
         7  02:00  Planning report
         10 03:00  Writing on the planning report

----Week 5
         13 04:00  Wrote a unsigned raymarcher shader which shows the distance 
	           function in grey scale. https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldfyRH 
         15 02:00  Made the marcher a little bit better and faster. read some on 
	           lighting.
         17 05:00  Rewrote the shader for better camera management and also 
	           optimized the marching loop in several ways.
