----Week 3
        31  02:00  Reading about raymarching, specifically what kind of basic

----Week 5
		 13 04:00  Wrote a unsigned raymarcher shader which shows the distance function in grey scale. https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldfyRH 
		 15 02:00  Made the marcher a little bit better and faster. read some on lighting.
		 17 05:00  Rewrote the shader for better camera management and also optimized the marching loop in several ways.
