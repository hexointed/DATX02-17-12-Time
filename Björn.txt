2017-01-17  03:00  Lecture + first meeting with group
        18  01:00  Signed distance functions and multivaraible calculus.
        19  03:00  Read earlier planning and finished reports, tested methods
                   for creating signed distance functions from any curve using 
                   gradient displacement.

----Week 2
        23  05:00  Lecture about source-criticism, writing on the report.
        24  02:00  Lecture on writing a planning report.
        26  06:00  Planning report, ray marching shaders with all group members.
        27  01:30  Finished the edge.edx course.
            05:00  More planning report, gradient stepping heuristic, meeting.

----Week 3
        30  03:00  Trying to do raycasting with shadertoy.
     02-01  01:00  More raycasting.
        02  01:00  Added raymarching to the shader.
        03  02:00  Worked some more on the shader and had a meeting.
